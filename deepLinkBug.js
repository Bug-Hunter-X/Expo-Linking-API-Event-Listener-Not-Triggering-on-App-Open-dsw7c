This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.addEventListener` method might not trigger if the app is already open and a deep link is tapped. This typically happens when a user clicks a deep link that should open or update the app's current state. The expected behavior is that the app should receive and process the URL, but instead, nothing happens. The app does not update and the `url` parameter of the event listener remains empty.

```javascript
Linking.addEventListener('url', (url) => {
  console.log('url:', url);
  // Handle the URL here
});
```
